# Numberplate-Recognition-YOLOv5

Collected around 2000 images of Vehicles and Annotated the Vehicles and their Numberplates using LabelIMG
Trained the images using the YOLOv5s (for only 10 epochs because of hardware constraints) and this public repo consists of the samples of the data of which I tested the model.
The Accuracy isn't that great, but the point being, the model has done pretty decently well with the unbalanced mix of data. 
The next step would be to crop the numberplates alone and extract the text out of them.
